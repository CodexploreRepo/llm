## Ouput Parser
- Chain-of-thought Reasoning (ReAct):
  - `Thought`: give a topic to LLM to think
  - `Action`: to carry a specific action
  - `Observation`: to show what it learn from that action
- If you have a prompt that instructs the LLM to use these specific keywords, thought, action, and observation, then this prompt can be coupled with a parser to extract out the text that has been tagged with these specific keywords.
