      "1. Personalized Message: Start by writing a personalized message that speaks to your friendship with Andrew. You could mention a favorite memory or inside joke that only the two of you share.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Happy birthday to my favorite friend, Andrew! I can't believe it's been [X] years since we met. You've been there for me through thick and thin, and I'm so grateful for your friendship. Here's to another year of adventures and good times together! 🎉\"\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Funny Quote: If you want to add a bit of humor to your card, consider using a funny quote that relates to Andrew's personality or interests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Happy birthday to the most awesome Andrew in the world! May your day be as epic as your beard and your love for [insert hobby or interest here] 😂\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Heartfelt Words: If you want to express your feelings in a more heartfelt way, try writing a message that speaks to the importance of Andrew in your life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Andrew, you're more than just a friend to me. You're a constant source of support, laughter, and inspiration. I'm so grateful to have you in my life, and I can't wait to see what the next year brings for you. Happy birthday, my dear friend! ❤️\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Inside Joke: If you and Andrew share a special inside joke or reference, consider including it in your card. It will make the message more personal and meaningful to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Happy birthday to the one and only Andrew! May your day be as awesome as the time we [insert inside joke here] 😂\"\n",
      "\n",

      "1. Use more formal language: Vietnamese is a formal language, and it's better to use formal language in a birthday card. You can use more polite words and phrases to show respect to the birthday person.\n",
      "2. Be more specific: Instead of saying \"I remember the times we went for long walks on the beach and read books at the bookstore\", you could say \"I remember the time we went for a long walk on the beach and read books together at the bookstore on a sunny day\".\n",
      "3. Use more vivid language: Vietnamese language is rich in descriptive words, you can use more vivid language to make the message more interesting. For example, instead of saying \"I hope your birthday will be decorated with light blue\", you could say \"I hope your birthday will be a beautiful day with a sky full of light blue clouds\".\n",
      "4. Add more personal touch: You can add more personal touch to the message by mentioning specific memories or inside jokes that you share with the birthday person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's an example of how you could rewrite the message:\n",
      "\n",
      "Chúc mừng sinh nhật Andrew!\n",
      "Andrew, ngày sinh nhật của bạn đã đến rồi! Tôi hy vọng bạn sẽ có một ngày sinh nhật tuyệt vời với những người thân yêu và những hoạt động yêu thích của bạn.\n",

      "\n",
      "Tôi hy vọng ngày sinh nhật của bạn sẽ là một ngày đẹp trời với một bầu trời đầy mây xanh. Tôi cũng hy vọng bạn sẽ được gặp những con gấu trúc yêu thích của bạn.\n",
